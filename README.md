## Author Information

This role was created in 2016 by [Karl Hepworth](https://twitter.com/fubarhouse).

This role was created due to having unavailable options of success. It was created because I failed to get the galaxy role [sa-teamcity](https://github.com/softasap/sa-teamcity) to work correctly or test correctly. I hope it helps others.
